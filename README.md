As a beginner in the coding world, the hardest part was understanding the language and how to use it. The idea is simple, 
you tell the program what you want to do and it does it, but the way you have to write functions, loops, if statements, 
is incredibly difficult to grasp. I was lucky to mentee under a Senior Software Engineer who tailored my learning to
my specific strengths, making it easier for me to understand.

This repository and these files are used in the hopes that others starting their journey, will be able to understand the 
syntax involved with Python and later, other languages that I found difficult. 

Languages hoping to cover:
- Python
- SQLite
- Flask api
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

installs you'll need:
- pip intall
-- python3
-- sqlite3
-- flask
